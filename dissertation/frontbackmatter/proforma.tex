\chapter*{Proforma}


\section*{Original aims}

The aim of this project is to apply a broadcast encryption scheme to content shared over Facebook by means of an extension for the Firefox web browser.


\section*{Work completed}

The extension can augment the Facebook web UI with encrypted submission controls. It is also capable of automatically retrieving and deciphering content as the user browses the Facebook site. Text content and images are supported. Resource heavy algorithms are contained in a shared object library written in C++.


\section*{Special difficulties}

Elements of the 2010 Information Theory and Coding course (not taught this year) were required.
