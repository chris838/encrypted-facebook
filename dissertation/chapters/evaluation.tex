Hypothesis - Upsampled3 is the best method
Testing -	MATLAB or actual code (or both??) 	
                How long it takes
                Capacity
                Error rate
Conclude - yes Upsampled3 is the best method

Cognitive walkthrough 
        Creating a group of users
        Migrating profile information
        Public key management
        Text submission and retrieval
        Image submission
        Image retrieval

*! MAYBE - just do one walkthrough with lots of users !*
*! OR - split walkthrough in to two halves !*
*! ALSO - could include non-users in walkthrough for last reqirement!*

Hypothesis - Waiting times are not a problem
Testing -	How long does each bit take
                Not including the image bit, already done
                Break down of what takes how long
Conclude - look at literature on perceptual waiting loading times, its all fine.
