It works

	Cognitive walkthrough 
		Creating a group of users
		Migrating profile information
		Public key management
		Text submission and retrieval
		Image submission
		Image retrieval

	*! MAYBE - just do one walkthrough with lots of users !*
	*! OR - split walkthrough in to two halves !*


It would work if deployed large scale
	
	Hypothesis - Upsampled3 is the best method
	Testing -	MATLAB or actual code (or both??) 	
			How long it takes
			Capacity
			Error rate
	Conclude - yes Upsampled3 is the best method

	Another cognitive walkthrough? Or extend the previous one?
		- obviously with much more recipients ~500


The above, plus doesn't affect normal FB use or browsing

	Hypothesis - something about the time
	Testing -	How long does each bit take
			Not including the image bit, already done
			Break down of what takes how long
	Conclude - look at literature on perceptual waiting loading times, its all fine.

The above, plus doesn't affect other FB users without extension


	Hmmmmmmmmm?
