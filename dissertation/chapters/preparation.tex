\section{Approaches}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Approaches in existing work
        
	\item Model of where the app could sit
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Proxy server (remote)
        
                \item Facebook application (client JavaScript)
        
		\item Bookmark button (client JavaScript + remote state on server)
                
		\item Greasemonkey (client JavaScript)
                
		\item Extension (client JavaScript + native code + local state)
        \end{itemize}
        
	\item Why good/bad? Try to be quantatative
        
	\item Leads on to lanugage and library choices
        
	\item How to call C++ from JavaScript (binding, linking, compilation, marshalling).
                
	\item Facebook Graph API (JavaScript API etc.)
    \end{itemize}

\section{Broadcast encryption}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Naive implementation
	\item More advanced schemes (and why I don't use them)
	\item Key management and size (NIST recommendations)
    \end{itemize}
    
\section{Storing data in images}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Description of Facebook/JPEG compression process (problem statement)
	\item Analysis of theoretical capacity
	\item Evaluation of naive implementations (MATLAB demonstrations)
            \begin{itemize}
		\item Completely naive (encode in RGB values)
		\item Even less so (encode in DST with bit masks)
             \end{itemize}
	\item Possible approaches (refer to research on Haar stuff etc.)
    \end{itemize}

\section{Testing plan}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item What kinds of testing will I use?
	\item How can I make these tests possible?
	\item Test bed or framework that needs to be in place
    \end{itemize}
    
    
\section{Proffesional practice stuff}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Software development model
	\item Version/source control
	\item Performance bounds
    \end{itemize}
    
    
\section{Requirements analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Functional and non-functional
	\item Same as success criteria, but *derive* them
	\item Possible requirements:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item it works (for small groups)
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item must be able to do X,Y,Z.
                        \item encryption must be sound (refer to NIST etc.)
                    \end{itemize}
                \item it *would* work for lots of people
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item image method must be modular - allow choice max capacity, future upgrade.
                        \item UI and text input must also scale to X number of recipients
                    \end{itemize}
                \item the above without affecting normal FB/browsing
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item doesn't add massive timing loads
                        \item doesn't introduce any security holes
                    \end{itemize}
                \item the above and doesn't negatively affect people without the extension.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
