Facebook is most common social network with X million users and Y daily hits. Currently all communication in plaintext. Single sentence description of project and what it does. Single sentence definition of broadcast encryption.

\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}

    \item General context - recent media coverage of Facebook, privacy and security concerns. Data (user passwords) stolen from web sites by hackers. Privacy a big issue for the 21st century?
  
    \item Problems with confusing users and complicated interfaces (e.g. Facebook defaults). Problems with intrusiveness (e.g. SSL and Google, Facebook). Demand for privacy/security soutions that are UNOBTRUSIVE and TRANSPARENT.

    \item New social networking services being launched (Diaspora etc.). Some have excellent security properites. Problem: networking effects and Facebook user base make it hard to compete.
    
    \item Idea : keep using Facebook, add encryption layer on top, seamlessly integrate in to normal Facebook experience.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

What the application does not do:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does not hide the social graph. Arguably this is Facebook's real asset. But that's another story...
    \item Does not ensure integrity of data. Facebook employees could swap your messages.
    \item Does not ensure availability. Facebook could easily wipe your notes or images.
    \item Does not ensure authenticity or non-repudiation. Not from the employees of Facebook anyway.
    \item Threat model not comprehensive due to project limitations. You can turn off images, which haven't been audited. Would obviously change this if deployed.
\end{itemize}


\section{Existing work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric only schemes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item FireGPG - \url{http://blog.fortinet.com/encrypting-facebook/}
        \item CryptFire
        \item TextCrypt - \url{http://subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=210&products_id=207}
    \end{itemize}
    
    Lots of these around.
    
    \item Complete schemes:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item uProtect.it
        \item flyByNight - \url{http://hatswitch.org/~nikita/papers/flybynight.pdf}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
