Facebook is most common social network with X million users and Y daily hits. Currently all communication in plaintext. Single sentence description of project and what it does. Single sentence definition of broadcast encryption.

\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}

    \item General context - recent media coverage of Facebook, privacy and security concerns. Data (user passwords) stolen from web sites by hackers. Privacy a big issue for the 21st century?
    
    \item Context in the field of Computer Science - new social networking services being launched (Diaspora etc.). Networking effects and Facebook user base make it hard to compete. Idea : keep using Facebook, add encryption layer on top.
    
    \item Limitations - does not hide the social graph. Arguably this is Facebook's real asset.

\end{itemize}
